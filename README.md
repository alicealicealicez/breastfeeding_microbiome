# breastfeeding_microbiome

Studies have shown that breast milk is also the strongest determinant of gut microbiota composition, and as a result can have lasting positive impacts on both the infant’s metabolism and immune system. The composition of human breastmilk contains important molecules called human milk oligosaccharides, which microbes such as Bifidobacterium rely on for survival. Although many other microbe-host interactions in humans still lack information, this symbiotic relationship
based on HMOs was originally discovered in mice. It was established that Bifidobacterium presence in the guts of infants has significant benefits, therefore the study was interested in gaining insight on the specific mechanisms relating to metabolites allowing the bacterium to be beneficial.

This study sought to replicate some of the findings from Laursen et al. (2021).

Laursen, M.F., Sakanaka, M., von Burg, N. et al. Bifidobacterium species associated with breastfeeding produce aromatic lactic acids in the infant gut. Nat Microbiol 6, 1367–1382 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-021-00970-4

### Figure 1###
Replicates figure 1c from the original paper. Aimed to see if breastfeeding status had any impacts on the fecal amino acid metabolite concentrations in infants using PCA. 

### Figure 2###
Replicates figure 1d from the original paper. Sought to identify which metabolites have the highest correlation to Bifidobacterium concentrations using a Spearman’s Rank heatmap.
